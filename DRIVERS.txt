IMPORTANT:
----------

Make sure the CAN device driver itself is installed, and for building the corresponding
CAN-Server make sure that the driver library (.h/.lib) is installed
and the .dll is copied to where the binary lies/is executed.


For the PEAK PCAN driver read 3rd/lib/pcan/README.txt .


For the Sontheim driver library download the MT-API from the download center at
	https://www.sontheim-industrie-elektronik.de/de/support/downloads/mt-api-/-treiber/
and run the contained installation program. Install to
    C:\Programme\Sontheim\MT_Api .
If it's already installed in a different path, then adapt
    can_server_sontheim_mt.vcproj .

	
For the Vector XL driver library download
    https://www.vector.com/int/en/search?type=%5B%22downloads%22%5D&page=1&q=XL%20Driver%20Library&pageSize=50&sort=date&order=desc&
and run the contained setup program. Install the CanXL driver to default, which is
and run the contained setup program. Install the CanXL driver to default, which is
    C:/Users/Public/Documents/Vector XL Driver Library .
If it's already installed in a different path, then adapt
    can_server_vector_xl.vcproj .

	
For the LAWICEL driver (library) download
    http://www.can232.com/download/canusbdrv018.zip
and
    http://www.can232.com/download/CDM_2.04.16_CANUSB.zip

Follow the driver installation guide
    https://www.vctec.co.kr/web/product/lawicel/documents/canusb_drinst_vcp.pdf
When
 reading, particularly find out if you have to temporarily
disconnect the PC from the Internet during installation.
Eventually install to
    C:\Programme\LAWICEL\CANUSB .
If it's already installed in a different path, then adapt
    can_server_lawicel.vcproj .

To use the CAN-Server with the Advantech-Dongle:

Download the EMCB DLL from https://www.advantech.com/support/details/software-api?id=1-T2RQ23 (the DLL is contained in the folder)
and put it into the folder where the CAN Server application is located.


For the Kvaser Mini PCI Express HS v2 drivers:

- Windows:
  download the installation package kvaser_drivers_setup.exe from
  https://www.kvaser.com/download/?utm_source=software&utm_ean=7330130980013&utm_status=latest
  and run it

- Linux:
  system requirements:
    - Linux 2.6.29 or later
    - header files and compiler for kernel compilation
      - in Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install build-essential
      - in other systems: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
  drivers download:
    - wget --content-disposition "https://www.kvaser.com/downloads-kvaser/?utm_source=software&utm_ean=7330130980754&utm_status=latest"
    - tar xvzf linuxcan.tar.gz
    - cd linuxcan
    - make
    - sudo make install (this will install the drivers and "canlib", necessary to build the specific version of the CAN-Server)
    - sudo make load    (will cause the virtual and PCI drivers to be loaded at boot time. This might be bad if experimenting with the device drivers)
