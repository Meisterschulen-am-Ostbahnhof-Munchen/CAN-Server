IMPORTANT:
----------

Make sure the CAN device driver itself is installed, and for building the corresponding
CAN-Server make sure that the driver library (.h/.lib) is installed
and the .dll is copied to where the binary lies/is executed.


For the PEAK PCAN driver read 3rd/lib/pcan/README.txt .


For the Sontheim driver library download the MT-API from the download center at
	https://www.sontheim-industrie-elektronik.de/de/support/downloads/mt-api-treiber/
and run the contained installation program. Install to
    C:\Programme\Sontheim\MT_Api .
If it's already installed in a different path, then adapt
    can_server_sontheim_mt.vcproj .

	
For the Vector XL driver library download
    https://vector.com/vi_downloadcenter_en.html?type=Driver&formular_treffer_submit=1
and run the contained setup program. Install the CanXL driver to default, which is
    C:/Users/Public/Documents/Vector XL Driver Library .
If it's already installed in a different path, then adapt
    can_server_vector_xl.vcproj .

	
For the LAWICEL driver (library) download
    http://www.canusb.com/drivers/canusbdrv018.zip
and
    http://www.canusb.com/cdm/CDM_2.04.06_CANUSB.zip

Follow the driver installation guide
    http://www.canusb.com/documents/canusb_drinst_vcp.pdf
When
 reading, particularly find out if you have to temporarily
disconnect the PC from the Internet during installation.
Eventually install to
    C:\Programme\LAWICEL\CANUSB .
If it's already installed in a different path, then adapt
    can_server_lawicel.vcproj .

To use the CAN-Server with the Advantech-Dongle:

Download the EMCB DLL from https://www.advantech.com/support/details/software-api?id=1-T2RQ23 (the DLL is contained in the folder)
and put it into the folder where the CAN Server application is located.
